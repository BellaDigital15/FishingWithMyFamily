    <h2>Where I am from is who I am</h2>
    <p>All of the places described above are the traditional tribes that occupy the unceded territory of the Heiltsuk Nation. All of the places display my family's origins, but today my family lives in Waglisla, also known as Bella Bella, B.C. This is our community and are surrounded by Heiltsuk Waters or also known as part of the Pacific Ocean. </p>

    <h2> Fishing with my family</h2>
    <p>Here is where the <em>salmon</em> has not only sustained my family for many generations, but for generations to come because we had lived and abided by the principles of ethical harvesting.<strong> We only kept our catch from fishing by never harvesting more fish than our family can consume. </strong> Much like a fishing crew, our family works together to preserve our salmon in varioius ways of drying, smoking, barbequing, jarring, canning, vaccuum packing.We harvest, preserve and eat meals together. My name is Georgia Larsen, I started my family with my husband Ian Larsen and together our son completes our family - Cassian. </p>
